# Numerical differential equation solver for Newtonian gravity with three gravitating bodies. Exploring chaotic systems in 2 and 3 dimensions.
Heres a gif of three objects interacting gravitationally. In general it is unlikely for there to be a stable way for all three to orbit each other, so one is ejected from the system, as seen here:
